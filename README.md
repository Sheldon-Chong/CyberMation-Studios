# CyberMation Studio

A software I've developed for the YouTube channel CyberLegends, which allows the creation of animated RPG-like textboxes. Using textboxes is the primary way that characters speak in the video.

## Origins of CyberMation Studio
Our animations are translated to English, Chinese, Brazil, and Spanish. Managing four channels is a demanding task, which is why we've developed this software to mass-translate scrips, and generate audio-visual textboxes based on character dialogues from the script.

Translating to other languages is as simple as replacing the text and pressing "render".

(Translation: "Let me propel you forward to your destination!")

It supports:
- Exporting to GIF, MP4 and PNG (static)
- Customizable colors and font
- Customizable voice-note
- Syntax highlighting for character dialogues
- Overriding dialogue lnies using a seperate file (used for multi-lingual translation)
- Character and text substitution
- Batch rendering using multiple threads

It is still being refined, and will include the following features: 
- Integration with Google Drive, to save files to the cloud, and to allow script editing using Google Docs and Google Sheets
- Translate dialogues within CyberMation studios using an LLM API
- Integration with Davinci Resolve, our primary video-editing software
